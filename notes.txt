Version-Control: This is the process where we can save a version of our code file and go back to it if we accidentally screw up the code in the future.

Working Directory: This is the folder that we initialise git.

Staging area: These are files that versions will be created for if changes are made to them at any time.

Git add: This command adds files to the staging area.

Git add + fullstop: This command adds all the files in the current directory to the staging area.

Git Status: This command shows the files that have been added to the staging area.

Git Commit -m: This command records the state of the file at a particular point in time and a commit message,
along with it.

Git log: This commad shows the history of all commited files.

Git diff (The name of the file): This command shows the difference between the previous version of a file and the current version.

Git checkout: This command returns a file to the last version that was commited.

The git process: Working Directory -> Staging area -> Git Repository.
